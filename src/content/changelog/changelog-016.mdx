## Cost Estimates

We’re introducing our first step towards FinOps within Baselime - you can now estimate the cost of AWS Lambda function invocations based on their configuration. This enables you to monitor the cost of your functions and allocate costs to specific business units. With the new `$baselime.cost` variable attached to all your invocations, you can slice and dice the cost of your AWS Lambda functions using the full powers of the Baselime query engine.

## Baselime Mark CLI Command

We’ve introduced the `baselime mark` command in our CLI. In addition to markers created automatically when deploying serverless stacks, you can now create markers for specific, notable events such as migrations or incidents yourself. The best part? The `baselime mark` command is seamlessly integrated with [all major CI/CD providers](https://github.com/baselime/ci-pipelines) so it requires minimal setup.

## Improved Latency of Receptors

We’re constantly working to enhance your observability experience. We’re excited to announce our significant improvement to the latency of all Baselime telemetry receptors, especially the [OpenTelemetry](https://baselime.io/docs/sending-data/opentelemetry/) and [HTTP events](https://baselime.io/docs/sending-data/events-api/) receptors. This means the time necessary to send telemetry data to Baselime has been drastically reduced. How did we do this? By decoupling the process of receiving and processing the data, ensuring faster and more efficient data transmission.
