## Invocations View

Easily view all the Lambda function invocations that match a query. In addition to raw events, traces, and visualizations, this new feature provides you with a complete picture of your serverless functions.

## Error Aggregation

Easily view all the errors for each service or Lambda function on a single screen. Errors are automatically grouped using vector distances so you can identify and resolve issues faster.

## Service Health

With the new Service Health screen, you can get an at-a-glance view of your serverless services' health. It includes key metrics like the number of invocations, number of errors, cold starts, number of alerts triggered, p99 latency and cold starts.

## **Multi-account and multi-environment support**

You can now use our observability solution across multiple accounts and environments. This feature provides flexibility and scalability, allowing you to manage your serverless infrastructure more efficiently.

## ****Simplified AWS Account Connection****

With the simplified steps to [connecting your AWS account](https://baselime.io/docs/quick-start/#step-3-connect-your-aws-account), you can start running queries on your telemetry data with just a few clicks. We securely connect to your account through CloudFormation, and we keep you informed of the status of the integration at all times in the console.
