## Proactive Cold Starts

Weâ€™ve been closely monitoring AWS cold start behaviour and noticed a new trend a few months ago. AWS has now [documented this behaviour](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/troubleshooting-invocation.html#troubleshooting-invocation-initialization-gap), and we've incorporated it into Baselime. Are all cold starts are the same? Nope, some are warmer than others and that's why we now highlight the warm cold-starts in the Baselime console with a ðŸ”¥ icon. This proactive approach helps you identify and optimize the performance of your functions effectively.

## AND / OR Filters Support

We added a highly requested feature: support for AND / OR filters in your queries. Now, when you have multiple filters in a query, you can choose to combine them with either AND or OR. This enables you to fine-tune your queries and ask your telemetry data a wider range of questions.

## Simplified Inventory Table

We revamped the inventory table to make it more accessible and readable. Initially, it only displayed function latencies and cold starts but now also includes errors, number of invocations, and most recently, their estimated cost. With this simplified table, you can quickly grasp the performance and cost metrics of your functions at a glance.
