## Zero-latency OpenTelemetry Tracing

We're excited to announce that you can now trace your Lambda functions with OpenTelemetry without impacting performance. Our [AWS Lambda layer](https://github.com/baselime/lambda-node-opentelemetry) and Lambda extension make it possible to achieve zero-latency tracing. This means you can get detailed insights into the performance of your serverless environment without any negative impact on your application's performance.

## OpenTelemetry Logging

We made logging even better with our [OpenTelemetry Logging library](https://github.com/baselime/lambda-node-opentelemetry#adding-custom-events). Rather than logging, you can now enrich your OTel spans with rich context events. This library is easy to use and feels just like a logger. This enables you to get more detailed insights into your application's behaviour and performance.

The above code snippet will add a span event to your traces. This enables you and your team to use OpenTelemetry without drastically changing your processes. 

## Optimised Navigation

We simplified the navigation in the Baselime console some more so finding the info you need is even easier. We're always looking for ways to improve the user experience, and this update is just one of the ways we're doing that.

## Rehydrate CLI Command

We made it easy to rehydrate data past your retention period using the Baselime CLI. Retrieve otherwise lost data with just a few simple commands. This feature is handy if you need to analyze data for compliance or auditing purposes.
