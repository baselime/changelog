## S3 Archival

We know how important your data is to you. That's why we've added S3 archival to Baselime. All the telemetry data ingested into Baselime is now streamed to an [S3 bucket in your AWS account](https://baselime.io/docs/sending-data/overview/), giving you full control over your data and long-term archival.

## Deployments

Keeping track of all your CloudFormation deployments has improved. Baselime now automatically detects deployments so you can view them listed per service, with details about the applied change-set. This enables you to quickly and easily see changes made to your infrastructure.

## Granularity

We understand that different queries require different levels of granularity. So we added the ability to define the time granularity of your queries. This enables you to get the insights you need, exactly as you need them.

## Contextual Dropdowns

We changed key dropdowns in the web console to provide more relevant details and improved clarity. This includes the dataset, operation and operators selectors. This enables you to quickly and easily find the information you need, without any confusion.

We've introduced alerts sent via email. Now alerts can be sent via email, Slack and webhook. This enables you to stay on top of any issues, no matter where you are.
