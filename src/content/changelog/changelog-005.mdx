## üíØ What‚Äôs New?

Sign up to Baselime today [here](https://console.baselime.io). Read on for what we shipped this month.

### XRay Traces

Baselime now automatically ingests traces from AWS X-Ray. You can now use your traces for queries and and alerts. A common use case is to alert on failed DynamoDB operations for example.

Moreover, you can correlate all your AWS Lambda logs with X-Ray traces, with no code changes. If the Lambda function is instrumented and sampled, you get this out of the box.

### OTel

Yes, we know you want to use OpenTelemetry for your tracing, we got you covered.

Not only will we ingest your OTel traces, we are also building the fastest and most lightweight OTel tracer for Node.js Lambda functions. Drop us a star on [Github](https://github.com/Baselime/lambda-node-opentelemetry)!

Once in Baselime, your can explore your traces and use them as you would any other event in Baselime; set your configurations as code, run queries, define alerts, slice and dice in the CLI, etc.

### Observability Templates

For those who are not quite sure where to start with o11y for their serverless architectures, we're building our public library of observability templates. With these, you can select the sort of services you're building once your AWS account is connected to Baselime. Is it an API? Does it use SQS, or DynamoDB ? We're building extensive templates to get the best-in-class observability on those services.

Pick your templates and start with the baseline observability you need. Once you're more familiar with how things work, dive deep and slice and dice your data at will.

Our o11y templates are all open sourced and are accessible in [our docs](https://docs.baselime.io/templates/overview/) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/Baselime/templates) (Don't forget to star us üåü).



### Web Console and CLI

Check out our new [console](https://console.baselime.io) and [CLI](https://docs.baselime.io/cli/install/). I'm sure you'll like them - we're looking forward to getting your feedback :) 


### Pricing Strategy

Common question, quite a few people asked us how we would be charging for Baselime while we were in private beta.

Simple answer, we are as developer friendly as is viable. Firstly, we offer a generous free plan. Secondly, a usage-based plan on the number of events your architecture emits, with small increments to avoid unexpected such that you never get an unexpected bill. Moreover, if for some reason you were to go beyond the number of events you had planned for, simply let us know, we've been there and we're always happy to work with you on these things.

## üéØ What‚Äôs Next?

- **More templates:** The next month is all about providing you with more tools to get started with as little friction as possible
- **More community activities:** Our community has been focused on feedback over the past few months. We plan to make it a more vibrant community of serverless enthusiasts from all around the world; [join us](https://join.slack.com/t/baselimecommunity/shared_invite/zt-1hea7g9uu-z69IghjEqPqD4P0rRlEQVw).
