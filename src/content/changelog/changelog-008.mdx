## Baselime CDK

We understand the value of Observability as Code - it enables you to keep observability as a first-class citizen of your architecture. We’re introducing [Baselime CDK](https://github.com/Baselime/cdk), a set of CDK constructs to interact with the Baselime management API directly from your AWS CDK code. Create all your queries, alerts and dashboards within the CDK.

## Markers API

You can now create markers using the Baselime API. Markers indicate significant or interesting events that occurred in your architecture, outside of your telemetry data - they’re typically used for deployments and can also be used to mark migrations, outages or system upgrades.

The Baselime Markers API is currently available at `https://go.baselime.io/v1/markers`. Markers will be implemented visually in the console in the coming weeks.

## Simplified CLI

The [Baselime CLI](https://github.com/Baselime/cli) is continuously being improved based on your feedback (thanks!). We have removed most of the “management” commands in favour of brevity and simplicity. Also, we renamed a few commands to better reflect your understanding of their purpose.
