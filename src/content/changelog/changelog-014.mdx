## Automatic OpenTelemetry Tracing

Baselime now enables you to automatically instrument your Node.js AWS Lambda functions with OTel. Simply add the baselime:tracing [tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-tags.html) to your Lambda functions, we’ll take care of the rest. You can effortlessly get industry-standard distributed tracing, and improve the performance and behaviour of your Lambda functions without any manual configuration.

## GitHub Signup

Are we really a developer tool without GitHub signup? You can now create a Baselime account using your GitHub credentials.

## Automated Error Surge Notification

It’s critical for any serverless team to be alerted when the number of errors in their architecture suddenly and drastically increases.

It's why we introduced automated email notifications for error surges. This email has error surges conveniently grouped by services and provides a direct link to the root cause. In the coming weeks, we’ll expand this feature to allow fine-tuning of the sensitivity such that it matches your architecture specifically.
